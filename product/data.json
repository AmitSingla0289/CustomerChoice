Needless to say I'm on the computer all day I have relatively large hands and the mouse doesn't feel small. Great feels, love all the controls and the free spin is great. I personally do not like weights in my mouse so I do not use them. The response settings are awesome, various different levels so there isn't too big of a jump between them allowing for better and more comfortable control.

            "review_text": "For a gaming mouse, I always look for four things: - comfort for a hybrid palm/claw grip - two thumb buttons - clicky, tactile wheel - decent weight This mouse feels and looks solid. But the added weights didn't add any value as the default weight is just right for me out of the box. The RGB lights are a nice touch but unnecessary. Unless you want swagger, it's not a feature one would go for. Thank goodness I want swagger. As soon as I got this in my hand, it felt more solid and comfortable than I could have guessed from the product photos. However, this mouse ends up feeling second-rate compared to the superior G900 and the budget-friendly G403. Especially with the G403, the G502 Proteus Spectrum is lacking in the palm comfort and just feels too noisy in terms of button placement. The worst part about this mouse has to be the wheel. The wheel is plastic with a metallic finish, which makes for terrible finger grip. Sure, they made it tactile, but it feels wrong and cannot compare to a rubberized wheel. This decision is quite possibly the worst thing that Logitech has ever made with their mice. For something I'd be holding on to for hours at a time, you'd think this mouse would be able to beat out the cheaper G403, but it just further proves that price isn't everything, and that's why I love Logitech. I will probably use it on my backup server where my mice rarely get used, which is just a waste of $120. If I hadn't picked up the G403 or G900, I probably wouldn't have buyer's remorse. On its own, it's not a bad mouse, but it's certainly not the right mouse for me. Said no cat ever.",

Took the opportunity to swap to this mouse and never looked back! The grip I prefer far better, with a nice place for your thumb to rest, the button placements and the amount or great. (Not too many, not too few). The weight system is awesome to have, I currently have it loaded to full weight because I prefer a heavier mouse but you can also make it quite light! The cable is braided and is durable, as is the general build of the mouse. However, one thing that disappointed me is the paint or whatever material is used to colour the mouse wheel black is coming off in areas I use often. Though it doesn't affect anything. The sensor is wonderful, as it should be! It is considered one of, if not the best sensor on the market right now! A big step up from Razer. Lastly the software is very good! It's a no BS type of style which is great especially coming from Razer's terrible software. The only complaint I have for it is that it doesn't scale in 4K and is near impossible to read on small displays.",

I haven't had any tracking issues yet, and being able to modify the weight of the mouse is quite helpful to get the best experience on whatever size mouse pad/area you use (I find if you have a small area to play with, making the mouse high sensitivity and heavy works best, while a large play area allows for low sensitivity and light configuration). The mouse has been mostly good for me, but there are a couple area's I feel it could improve upon. First, one or two of the weights are a bit tricky to remove from my mouse. This is somewhat of a good thing, because the weights won't come loose mid-game, but I think a tool to remove them could be included. Secondly and more importantly, the cable on the mouse is not able to be easily replaced. This means that a damaged cord will require the mouse to be mailed in for repairs or you could take a crack at opening the mouse and trying to repair it yourself if you like, or of course you could end up replacing the mouse entirely. A mouse this expensive should really be able to easily swap out damaged cords.",

I tested the unit in multiple locations, including in the same room as the WiFi router all with the same terrible speed results. I tested by downloading files from a server in my house wired to the WiFi router, the files ranged from 10Mb to 1Gb. Connecting directly to the WiFi router my throughput was 2.9MB/s to 3.2MB/s. When connecting to the NetGear extender and downloading the same files, my throughput dropped to 690KB/s to a peak of 870KB/s, but averaged at only 810KB/s. The extender reported a good connection (green light) to both my WiFi router and the computer downloading the files, so connection was not the issue. Considering these tests were with just a single computer connected to the extender, I would hate to see the performance of HD streaming or multiple devices at the same time. Returning the unit.",

I use it mostly for extra coverage in my back yard, but no matter what set up I use or where I move the router or range extender the WiFi still seems to have spotty internet that drops off periodically. It's good for just browsing the web, but it can be frustrating to use for video streaming. I bought this with the intention of streaming videos to my chromecast onto a projector into my backyard, so the range extension and speed needed to be above and beyond the rest. It worked for 2 hours straight one night, but then, with no changes to the physical setup, the internet started dropping every 5 minutes and never recovered for the night. With the range extender being 14 horizontal feet and 6 vertical feet away from the extender, separated with a finished ceiling, standing 15 feet further away from them in the back yard, I am able to get 8.77 Mbits down and 3.88 Mbits up in the back yard, which is decent enough for streaming HD videos from youtube, generally. Overall a wise purchase. It's worked better than anything else I've used so far. I'm going to try to move things around a bit and see if they work better or if I can get slightly faster speeds.",

There is a bit of speed loss from the main router but not enough to interfere with the streaming which is flawless. I deducted one star only because you have to log on using a web interface which I did on my phone. There is an app to check network quality but it really does not apply to the extender. There is no app to setup the extender but the web interface worked well. I simply bookmarked the page to the home screen and that was that. I would much rather have had an app instead but that is being really picky.

I I tested this out by putting the extender right next to my router. My original bandwidth is 70Mbps and this was showing maximum 10Mbps. And when i moved it to the actual position I wanted the coverage, the bandwidth dropped to 5Mbps. I had trouble making voice and video calls when 2 devices were online at the same time. So, overall. This did not solve my problem and its sitting in the return shipping. I am not sure if any other extender in this price range does a better job. I am not willing to take another risk and will just go with purchasing a powerline + wifi router to extend my coverage.",

            "review_text": "First Off, my Vive arrived on a Thursday and broke that Sunday. I am getting it replaced, free of charge by Amazon. HTC tried to help me get it back up and running but to no avail. They have great customer service. I am not happy that this happened, but I also understand that with mass production, sometimes things happen or don't work as they should all the time. Now, on to the review! This thing is AMAZING! I have never gotten such a workout in my life. I am a computer guy. I like to play games and research stuff on the internet. This has unfortunately led to an unhealthy lifestyle and I needed to shed a few pounds. I wanted to get a VR system anyway so I thought may be this would be a great way to kill two birds with one stone. And it is. This thing tricks you. You think you're just having fun playing games, but no. It is a full body workout and I love it! I have never been able to find something that was fun and exercise at the same time, but now I have it. I have an approximately 3m x 1.5m room-scale setup. While this works without a hitch most of the time, I would definitely recommend a 3m x 2m space if at all possible. I play Audioshield, Holopoint, The Golf Club VR, Superhot VR, Sword Master VR and Raw Data for exercise and activity. Of these, Holopoint and Audioshield are definitely the most intensive... but they are also a blast to play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone who has a powerful enough PC and can afford it, and would also like to get a nice workout in their own home. Now, a few other things; -The screen door effect is pretty bad unfortunately. However, as my HMD did die after 3 days, this may have just been a faulty or defective item. I will have to wait and see. -I wear glasses. I did not have problem with making the headset feel comfortable at all. Very spacious if you wear glasses. -My hand tracking seemed to be a bit wacky sometimes. However, I am gonna go out on a limb and blame myself for this one and say it was my fault for bad sensor placement. - I have an i7 5930k and a GTX 1080 TI. I never had any problems with framerates or whatnot.",

            "review_text": "First off, going to say, you need to fork out a lot of money for this toy, this is not cheap and don't expect a price drop like the RIFT because as Gabe Newell said, Valve's loss of sales on this toy does not affect them at all nor do they care if it ends up as a total failure. That sounds like some really confident people! The great thing about it is supported by Steam not Facebook. I have owned it since Feb. Have to say, I have had no issues at all whatsoever, the hardware is great, top notch, VR is so amazingly immersive, the games are great, just bought a deluxe audio strap too recently, I have no negatives for this headset beside one thing and one thing only. Eye Tracking. VR could really use Eye Tracking. I wish this had Eye Tracking. Other thing is I wish the stock foam didn't suck so much, I sweat a lot and I can only enjoy 2 hours of gaming before taking the headset off. I wish the foam was actually some sweat fighting leather instead. All and all 5/5 from me.",

The system itself is an amazing piece of technology and the illusion created by accurate tracking and room scale is one that I have not seen matched by either the PSVR or the Occulos (although the Occulos is close when using 3+ sensors). After extended periods of use however, I've noticed that the screen door effect is becoming more prevalent, this mostly happens when I unfocus my eyes while thinking. If you play games that are still interesting to you, you'll be really immersed in the experience. Everybody I let try my headset have been amazed. Videos are not able to do it justice. I was playing a game called smash party recently and accidentally smashed one of the controllers full force into my wall, I dented the wall but the controller still works fine!",

However, customer support was incredibly nice and helpful, and had me up and rolling in a few hours. I also have a PSVR and have used the Oculus Rift, and must say that this is by far the best and most amazing VR experience out there. I would highly recommend this to anybody, but do have some warnings! Firstly, be prepared for lots of glitches and problems while using this. While there are a couple hardware issues, most of the glitches are software glitches. These are all solvable, but might require some time and troubleshooting. Anybody good with computers should have no problems, but for example my parents would be utterly lost. Secondly, make sure your PC specs are well above the minimum required specs to run the HTC Vive. My computer is a bit more powerful than the minimum requirements, and has at times had serious problems trying to run some software on the Vive. Overall this product is amazing and I highly recommend it for those wanting the best possible VR experience. For those looking to get into VR without the hassle or the expensive PC build, I would highly recommend the PSVR.",

            "review_text": "Got this monitor as a part a Python programming server. Have been using Dell's Ultrasharp and S-series, why made the switch when I am to get a new one? Pros: Low Blue Light - It would be great as I am going to stare at text through this monitor for a while Non-flicker - a big plus for reading text. Now try, shake your fingers left and right rapidly in front of your LCD monitor, do you see multiple fingers? This is because the PWM module powering the lighting didn't have a high enough frequency. In particular, when you set the monitor to low light, the flickering is more pronounced. This BENQ monitor is totally free from that as I checked. Most older Dell monitors, including the one I got 2 years ago, all suffered from this. So BENQ is a clear winner in terms of eyes caring. Cons: It is VA, not IPS as the panel technology. What it means is a worse color accuracy and view angle. What does it translate to? If you are serious about the color and you do some photoshop, or you will be viewing this monitor at a close distance/at an angle, you will then see the color changes a lot. I compared this directly with a Dell IPS monitor and I can say the difference is very significant. It is more like a TN panel monitor in terms of this, IPS are better options. In short, if you want a monitor healthy to your eyes and wallet, this is a very good monitor to think about. However it is not suitable if you expect large view angle or high color accuracy. An IPS monitor from Dell or even EIZO will be the better candidates.",

I had fairly basic needs with this purchase as I just wanted a 21 inch or bigger screen, 1080p, a tilt stand, Vesa mount compatible, and an HDMI port. This has everything I required and has been working great as a monitor for my home server, and the occasional time I use it as a second screen for my laptop. Image clarity is as expected, and as I normally use either high refresh rate or IPS monitors I am pleasantly surprised with this monitor from BenQ. There also are no dead pixels on my monitor, which I am happy to see. At a price of $129.99 (at the time of purchase) it\u2019s really hard to complain at all. This monitor is used almost daily, and it serves its task. And with a good included stand and Vesa mount compatible it can be very multi-functional.

The reason why I got this monitor and might help you decide is: -It's a VA panel, I like the contrast it gives, and I also LIKE how the viewing angle is a bit less than an IPS panel, it's like having an included privacy filter, although viewing angles are good. -It has HDMI input, built in speakers, but more importantly a built in 3.5mm headphone jack -VESA mountable -21.5\" is a good size, but small form factor.",

Normally that would only be a single point off, but when contacted, though swift, a BenQ tech suggested I try to fix it with multiple techniques --from wikihow of all websites!-- that would in all likelihood void the warranty. Including; striking the screen with a pen, pressing a bag of boiling water against the screen, and using third party \"screen enhancers\". The least egregious of the suggestions was to try an online dead pixel fixer (it didn't work). Now I honestly have no idea if these methods are standard or effective, or for that matter given in earnest, but the idea of striking a screen with a pen until it flashes rather alarmed me. Hopefully my next screen will not have any such problems.",

It's nice to be able to type things into XBMC / YouTube / etc. The keyboard itself has a few draw backs, but I'd bet all the small form-factor keyboards on the market would share my cons. Pros: - Seems to work fine about 4 meters from my HTPC - Integrated touchpad means I could ditch the mouse sitting under my coffee table Cons: - By default, function keys (F1, F2, etc) are the secondary functions to the media functions (Vol. Up, Mute, Next.) This means that instead of Alt+F4, you need three fingers to press Alt+Fn+F4. Maybe not the end of the world, but being someone who uses keyboard shortcuts a lot, I find it annoying! You are able to change this so the reverse is true, but it requires a software called \"Logitech Options.\" A simple shortcut would have been nicer. - It's small. I have big hands, so typing on what amounts to a netbook keyboard is difficult. Not a big deal if you're only typing in the odd movie name, or album artist. Pro/Con: - Uses the Logitech Unifying receiver. Means that you don't need another USB receiver if you're already using Unifying hardware. If you're using Bluetooth however, you'll need another USB port. - Top left yellow button is left-click. This is a duplication of the normal left click button below the track pad. I don't get it. Unless that button is re-programmable with software, why did that include it?",

If you can get a deal on it for roughly 20 bucks, its ok especially for use on a tv which it is pretty good at. Beware the small keys and size and the very small backspace button.

            "review_text": "Finally a great keyboard for the TV. Light and sturdy with essential keys and functions with a very good range. I have tried several other keyboards but the range was poor, even if I was sitting in front of the TV, any small item in between the keyboard and its receiver will block their operation, but not the Logitech K400. If you look for the scroll wheel, you will not find one, to make the screen scroll you have to slide 2 fingers on the touch pad to simulate a scrolling wheel. The scroll is not as responsive and precise as a scroll wheel, but you get used to it quickly. On top of all these positive points, its price was unbeatable when I purchased it on sale for around $31. I highly recommend it.",

I initially hoped that this keyboard would work specifically for YouTube and Netflix but the only thing that works for those apps are the arrow buttons so it did not really speed up my search time unfortunately. You can bypass this problem by using the web browser and using YouTube there, however the quality of the resolution is not the same as using the YouTube App directly. The batteries are included and there is an on/off switch on the top side of the keyboard. This is a nice size and quite light and I like the cursor pad. I sit about 5 meters away from the TV using this and it works flawlessly. I hope that one day YouTube and Netflix will update their wireless keyboard functionally so that this can be put more in use because it's a nice product.",

            "review_text": "Got this monitor as a part a Python programming server. Have been using Dell's Ultrasharp and S-series, why made the switch when I am to get a new one? Pros: Low Blue Light - It would be great as I am going to stare at text through this monitor for a while Non-flicker - a big plus for reading text. Now try, shake your fingers left and right rapidly in front of your LCD monitor, do you see multiple fingers? This is because the PWM module powering the lighting didn't have a high enough frequency. In particular, when you set the monitor to low light, the flickering is more pronounced. This BENQ monitor is totally free from that as I checked. Most older Dell monitors, including the one I got 2 years ago, all suffered from this. So BENQ is a clear winner in terms of eyes caring. Cons: It is VA, not IPS as the panel technology. What it means is a worse color accuracy and view angle. What does it translate to? If you are serious about the color and you do some photoshop, or you will be viewing this monitor at a close distance/at an angle, you will then see the color changes a lot. I compared this directly with a Dell IPS monitor and I can say the difference is very significant. It is more like a TN panel monitor in terms of this, IPS are better options. In short, if you want a monitor healthy to your eyes and wallet, this is a very good monitor to think about. However it is not suitable if you expect large view angle or high color accuracy. An IPS monitor from Dell or even EIZO will be the better candidates.",

This has everything I required and has been working great as a monitor for my home server, and the occasional time I use it as a second screen for my laptop. Image clarity is as expected, and as I normally use either high refresh rate or IPS monitors I am pleasantly surprised with this monitor from BenQ. There also are no dead pixels on my monitor, which I am happy to see. At a price of $129.99 (at the time of purchase) it\u2019s really hard to complain at all. This monitor is used almost daily, and it serves its task. And with a good included stand and Vesa mount compatible it can be very multi-functional.

The reason why I got this monitor and might help you decide is: -It's a VA panel, I like the contrast it gives, and I also LIKE how the viewing angle is a bit less than an IPS panel, it's like having an included privacy filter, although viewing angles are good. -It has HDMI input, built in speakers, but more importantly a built in 3.5mm headphone jack -VESA mountable -21.5\" is a good size, but small form factor.",

Including; striking the screen with a pen, pressing a bag of boiling water against the screen, and using third party \"screen enhancers\". The least egregious of the suggestions was to try an online dead pixel fixer (it didn't work). Now I honestly have no idea if these methods are standard or effective, or for that matter given in earnest, but the idea of striking a screen with a pen until it flashes rather alarmed me.

I only once bought RAM from G.Skill, but for the most part I buy Corsair RAM exclusively. I own their Value Select, Vengeance LPX, Vengeance LED, and Dominator Platinum RAM. If you want RAM that will perform as advertised and last forever this is the kit of RAM you want. I got this set at a great price a few months back in anticipation for this latest build. This particular set is for an ITX system. For this build I went with a white theme so naturally I wanted white RAM, and I didn\u2019t want tall RAM either. This Vengeance LPX kit was the perfect fit for my needs and it looks great in my system. It is paired with an Intel i5-7500 and an EVGA GTX 960 FTW ACX 2.0 4GB, and I get great system performance. This kit is also easy to set to its rated speed of 3000MHz; you simply go into your bios on start-up (hit F2 and Delete) then enable XMP and it should automatically set to 3000MHz depending on your motherboard. If not head to advanced settings, and then to AI Tweaker (Asus motherboards), and set your RAM to its rated speed, so 3000HMz for this set, then save your settings and exit. It\u2019s an easy process and allows you to use the full potential of your RAM, I have yet to have a problem setting any of my Corsair RAM to its rated speed. So for those of you looking for a great kit of RAM look no further. Corsair has many \u2018flavours\u2019 of RAM, and all sorts of colors so there\u2019s something for everyone. I swear by Corsair\u2019s ram and highly recommend this product to anyone interested! (Pictures attached)",

            "review_text": "Got this monitor as a part a Python programming server. Have been using Dell's Ultrasharp and S-series, why made the switch when I am to get a new one? Pros: Low Blue Light - It would be great as I am going to stare at text through this monitor for a while Non-flicker - a big plus for reading text. Now try, shake your fingers left and right rapidly in front of your LCD monitor, do you see multiple fingers? This is because the PWM module powering the lighting didn't have a high enough frequency. In particular, when you set the monitor to low light, the flickering is more pronounced. This BENQ monitor is totally free from that as I checked. Most older Dell monitors, including the one I got 2 years ago, all suffered from this. So BENQ is a clear winner in terms of eyes caring. Cons: It is VA, not IPS as the panel technology. What it means is a worse color accuracy and view angle. What does it translate to? If you are serious about the color and you do some photoshop, or you will be viewing this monitor at a close distance/at an angle, you will then see the color changes a lot. I compared this directly with a Dell IPS monitor and I can say the difference is very significant. It is more like a TN panel monitor in terms of this, IPS are better options. In short, if you want a monitor healthy to your eyes and wallet, this is a very good monitor to think about. However it is not suitable if you expect large view angle or high color accuracy. An IPS monitor from Dell or even EIZO will be the better candidates.",

I had fairly basic needs with this purchase as I just wanted a 21 inch or bigger screen, 1080p, a tilt stand, Vesa mount compatible, and an HDMI port. This has everything I required and has been working great as a monitor for my home server, and the occasional time I use it as a second screen for my laptop. Image clarity is as expected, and as I normally use either high refresh rate or IPS monitors I am pleasantly surprised with this monitor from BenQ. There also are no dead pixels on my monitor, which I am happy to see. At a price of $129.99 (at the time of purchase) it\u2019s really hard to complain at all. This monitor is used almost daily, and it serves its task. And with a good included stand and Vesa mount compatible it can be very multi-functional. This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in it!",

This monitor actually changed my enjoyment of using a computer, I was always doing things on my 13\" MacBook and decided to jump the gun and get an external monitor and the first thing I thought after the first day of using it was \"why didn't I get this sooner\"? The reason why I got this monitor and might help you decide is: -It's a VA panel, I like the contrast it gives, and I also LIKE how the viewing angle is a bit less than an IPS panel, it's like having an included privacy filter, although viewing angles are good. -It has HDMI input, built in speakers, but more importantly a built in 3.5mm headphone jack -VESA mountable -21.5\" is a good size, but small form factor.",

Normally that would only be a single point off, but when contacted, though swift, a BenQ tech suggested I try to fix it with multiple techniques --from wikihow of all websites!-- that would in all likelihood void the warranty. Including; striking the screen with a pen, pressing a bag of boiling water against the screen, and using third party \"screen enhancers\". The least egregious of the suggestions was to try an online dead pixel fixer (it didn't work). Now I honestly have no idea if these methods are standard or effective, or for that matter given in earnest, but the idea of striking a screen with a pen until it flashes rather alarmed me. Hopefully my next screen will not have any such problems.",
