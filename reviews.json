My website isn't a behemoth, though, so I can't testify so much on that part. Value: As a renewing customer, I was a bit disappointed by the price they offered me for a 3 years hosting.\nI was seeing better offers elsewhere (and even for Bluehost NEW customers) so I decided to leave.

When I first subscribed it was a matter of pricing->feature value, but the cPanel experience was weak and the upgrade process was hit and miss. Over the past three years BlueHost has resolved any issues I had with them.\nThey're cPanel is greatly improved, they're feature set is much broader with few limitations, and with their new reseller account options I can host clients without any of the problems I used to run in to. BlueHost's cPanel in particular is where the best value comes. When I started my subscription with them I was less than savvy about many things relating to hosting or marketing or anything else that would otherwise lead to solid web presence.\nThere are many included tools and promotions that BlueHost provides with the subscription that put me on the right track and led to more opportunities as I matured. Technical expertise is not a requirement as BlueHost has most of those tools available to you, but there is still enough flexibility for more savvy developers to get their hands dirty. The only one quorum I have is a lack of root level access, but that isn't a dealbreaker for myself personally.\nOverall I'd consider BlueHost as one of my favorite webhosts. There are others I've tried, but BlueHost has been the most reliable and their customer service team has always been quick and knowledgeable. For those who want a simple but reliable experience then BlueHost is the way to go; those who want complete control over their experience may not like how BlueHost does things.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": ["https://media.whoishostingthis.com/2/v241/images/host-logos/bluehost.png"], "website_name": ""}, {"absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/", "rating": "3", "review_title": null, "reviewed_at": null, "reviewer_name": "Abby  Brown", "category": "Hosting Service", "service_name": "Bluehost", "review_text": "\n            Bluehost support is bad.

I am also using the Cloudflare CDN which BlueHost and it has really improved the site's loading speed.So far, my site has been down only for once and that was just a few days after I switched to BlueHost.

I always give their support team kudos. However, in the past year, their email is getting worse and worse.\nTheir servers are black listed and they don't do anything about it. They respond with \"Try sending it again in an an hour when the servers rotate.\" This affects everyone in my business. We are working and with this kind of terrible service, we never know if your email goes through to a client or customer.\nTheir excuse is that email servers are shared so things like this happen. When I point out that email has been this way since before AOL and companies like AOL, gmail and others seem to deliver email just fine, the rep always seems to finally admit the senior management at Bluehost is not funding email support to force people to buy paid email services. IMO, email is a cost-of-doing-business type of feature.\nMeaning if I buy a car, a steering wheel is a cost-of-doing-business feature. I have a car (Bluehost) and it used to have steering wheel one hundred percent of the time. Now, the steering wheel is only there 70 of the time while I am driving.\nI then call the service department, they tell me it's not a safety risk. I should keep the car but get an Uber (Paid Gmail) to be able to get to work every day for reliability and safety. My answer is no thanks.\nI just get any other car on the market, even one like GoDaddy which I hate, and get a working steering wheel.

The person on chat never seemed to understand my problem. I even copied and pasted the error message from their site that explained the situation but to no avail.\nI couldn't see how my blog looked or access email while the domain remained with a temporary address.

The refund hadn't been posted to my credit card account on Tuesday so I called customer support and talked to a person who understood my original problem and offered to solve it. I said no, I would just like to get my refund.\nThey told me that I wouldn't be getting the refund for my domain name purchase because the person who was processing the refund on Monday didn't complete the process and it had been more than 3 days since I had purchased the domain name and they would only refund that purchase during the first 3 days. (By the way, Tuesday was 3 days after Saturday) I received an email detailing my refund (less the price paid for the domain name) on Tuesday but it hadn't been posted to my credit card on Wednesday. I filed a claim with the credit card company and they have issued me a provisional credit. I know that stuff happens but when a problem is brought to the attention of a support person the problem should be worked on.\nThe live chat people should have been able to solve my problem or pushed it up to someone who could.

He offered to fix it himself for free, but first I contacted support. They did not do much and claimed the site was in good standing with security.\nThey have their own \"intrusion detection/prevention system\" which stops their service from getting hacked, but I found out it doesn't actually protect my website. I reluctantly let the student fix my site after giving him my account details and he managed to find all kinds of flaws from the inside as well. He fixed most of them within a couple of days, from bad configuration, bad plugins, and hiding my personal email/account.\nI'm not very good with this kind of stuff but was astonished by how much the student was able to do that BlueHost was not able to do. The student also showed me that there were much cheaper hosting plans I could have gotten, and sure enough he was right, so I don't think the value is great for this host. Other than all that, the first setup of the website was really easy, only a few clicks and it was ready.

I got the answer direct from the ExpressVPN people. Here\u2019s what I did.\nExpressVPN customer support was, in the end, very precise, efficient, and well\u2026savvy.\nExpressVPN support also supplied (true to their name) an express way to remove the existing program with one command line entered into the terminal. Neat\u2026!\nThen they simply had me upgrade from v-6.5 to v-6.7.1 and that too, was with one express URL and a new Authorization code. Most companies don\u2019t do that. Translation: savvy customer support. \nSince I installed v-6.7.1, my CPU cycles for expressvpnd dropped from 98% to 0.1%. Uhhh\u2026.wow.\nThe only place what I am saying, compared with what you\u2019re saying, differs, is that after my upgrade installation to v-6.7.1, my Activity Monitor shows three files running (couldn\u2019t find a way to upload a png screenshot) with these %-age CPU cycles :\n ExpressVPN\t                                0.4%\t(main program)\n expressvpn-browser-helper\t0.0\t        (I installed their browser helper, so this is known)\n expressvpnd\t                        0.3\t        (I have no idea what this is or what it does)\nSo it\u2019s a mystery why your Mac installation shows no expressvpnd file. Anybody there know what that\u2019s about?\nIncidentally, Douglas, unlike two people on this thread complaining about crashing or major loss of speed, my installation is rock-steady for hours and hours day after day. Reliability is one of the things I like most about ExpressVNP and IPVanish. I run both. They\u2019re both great tools I\u2019ve been using them for about a year or more.\nThe good news is ExpressVPN is running a small footprint.\nLASTLY, I value your site highly for your rigorous checking, comparisons, and reviews.

My previous VPN vendor\u2019s Windows app had endless options and whenever you reported a problem to them their first response was to have you try turning each one on or off to see how it affected the problem. Extensive testing required that I wasn\u2019t willing to do for them \u2013 so my last problem before I left them wasn\u2019t resolved.\nFrom my initial experience, ExpressVPN is working well for me on my Chromebook and Android tablet with a few very minor hiccups but appears somewhat more flaky on my Windows PC. I am able to access certain financial web sites with ExpressVPN that I couldn\u2019t with my former VPN software, nicely enough. Their web site is polished and professional. I have generally decided though that you just have to expect more problem issues/complexity if you introduce a VPN to the mix. AND the prices quoted for the software are US$ !\nExpressVPN support is fairly quick and friendly but fairly knee-jerk unthinking. They seem to want to have you first try re-installing the software as an attempt at resolution for any problem. When you do convince them you are experiencing a bug, they just appear to suggest you wait for resolution in a future release or install a possibly problematic older release without indicating they are reporting your issue to development. I supplied an ExpressVPN diagnostics log for the problem I was experiencing but never got any indication back that they had looked at it. Their 24/7 chat facility seems to go down occasionally \u2013 I\u2019ve noticed it offline a couple of times in the two weeks I\u2019ve been a customer.\nAnd what seems to be the case for VPN software in general, their product is sensitive to PC total security software (BitDefender I found won\u2019t let their Windows app \u2018Speed Test\u2019 function work by default \u2013 a problem reported by other security software users on ExpressVPN\u2019s web site).\n\t\t\t\t", "picture_urls": ["https://dqmqbm17xhtln.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ExpressVPN-Logo-320-80-1-1.png.pagespeed.ce.J_zJrLBoT1.png"], "website_name": ""}, {"absolute_url": "https://www.bestvpn.com/expressvpn-review/", "rating": "8.2", "review_title": null, "reviewed_at": "28/04/2017", "reviewer_name": "Douglas Crawford ", "category": "VPN Service", "service_name": "Expressvpn", "review_text": "\n\t\t\t\t\tHi Ronald,\nThanks for sharing your detailed thoughts with us. With regards to VPNs and compatibility with other security products, the problem usually comes down to firewalls.
