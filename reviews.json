As a freelancer, I set a company up with a free domain and used my own name to initially set up the domain. The company never switched the info to their name and never used the services. Suddenly I am getting harassed by One.com since it's been a year and I owe them $36 some plus a $12 late fee. I figured like most free trials, if unused/unpaid for, they just cancel your account and that's that. Not keep it open and continually come after you for late payments. Granted, perhaps in the fine print they mentioned that you had to cancel 30 days before the expiration period or get charged, but it's still a super shady business model. They are profiting from other's misfortune with their shady services. After contacting them, they did offer to remove the late fee but had very little remorse, and when I tried to pay, my credit card held the payment due to potential fraud by Chase. Way to go, One.com.

And soon forgot about them. Went to their site as a learning experience on website building. So 6 months later I received a bill for $30+, and additional 12.99 late notice fee. No phone support is offered to discuss issues with them. A complete disconnect. So we went back and forth with emails and in the end they had no sympathy.

It's like throwing a bottle with a message into the ocean with some communication effort. And it's like being on an island in the ocean screaming for help. Wilson! My ticket was never addressed. Does this ring the bell? 5. They make their money by advertising very cheap plans and charging thousands of people for a promise they don't deliver. When people realize that they paid for nothing, it's too late. The fee is small, so people stop fighting in their efforts to get their money back. As a result, you have lost a small amount of money, your time on the Internet, your reputation with some of your clients (who are inherently patient for the most part, thank Goodness!), and your sanity.

After the first year the hosting continued to go down hill. It was more like 75% uptime. They must have started me off on the good server, then after a time moved my site to a less functional server or something. The customer service had gotten so bad that they would simply paste a link in the chat to direct you elsewhere. General questions like \"why is my site down\"? Would now require a support ticket. I moved my site to another host, it costs more, but I am getting what I pay for...so-to-speak. I referred WHW hosting to others in the past who either ended up retrieving a refund before the end of 30 days which WHW makes very difficult; or if they missed the 30 day money back, they simply moved their site. I moved my sites, but WARNED others that WHW was a frustration but an inexpensive way to get set-up....THAT'S ALL!!!. Unfortunately, not many people are as patient as I was.\r\n\r\nI am now building a site for a customer who insisted on inexpensive hosting just to get the feel of managing her own website. So I came back to WHW. I knew what to expect, but I am here to enlighten others that after 3 years it has simply gotten worse. \r\n\r\nMy new experience: It has been 3 days and the site is still not activated. The temporary url does not work either. For the last 3 days I have been told that the site will be up in just a few hours. The home page states \"Free Set-up and Instant Activation\", that's fine if in your language \"instant\" means 3 days; regarding the 30 day money back guarantee, on the second day that the site was not up I asked how I go about getting a refund, I have been continually told the site would be up in just a few hours. Going into day 4 I am still being told to wait just a few hours.\r\n\r\nMY RECOMMENDATION: $1.00 a month is appealing when you are setting up and designing a site. BUT!!! you are getting what you pay for. The home page Boast are NO LONGER TRUE! They were when I used this hosting for my sites for about 6 months, 3 years ago, NOT ANYMORE!!! The customer service is 24/7 HORRIBLE. If you venture in for the appealing $1.00 a month deal, just forget customer service, and put in a support ticket, you will spend less time waiting for an email than you will on a chat with customer service.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am pretty sure all of those other recent comments about how good the service is were written by the staff or the owners. But if you want to test the comments try it. They OFFER a 30 day money back guarantee???? At least that's what it says on the home page.

Heck, it should be an arsenal....don't walk--RUN the other way as fast as you can. I host my personal email as well as business email and website through BlueHost and have for more than 3 years. Suddenly in the last year their serve tanked, as has my website and mail numerous times.\r\nFirst let's talk about overall run time.  My website has been down more than 6 times in the last 8 months.  For a small business, that is a death sentence. It was even down the day I was scheduled for a redesign with my webmaster--great  My email went down several times as well, randomly, and I never knew it.  Then the biggie.\r\nThey shut off my accounts and turned off my website without notification.  It turned out they had expired. Well, I had called them more then 6 times, spending more than a total of 4 1/2 hours on hold trying to renew my accounts without ever being able to reach anyone.\r\nSo I renewed (don't ask me why), and they turned everything back on. The very next week I received a maintenance notice that they were doing \"emergency\" work on my server to protect my information and provide better service and my email would be down for 2 hours overnight. I awoke the next morning to NO email, past or present, so another 45 minute call for them to locate my emails and then reload them.\r\nLet's talk about tech support.  I bought a new iPhone and changed from an android, so needed new settings.  That took 3 phone calls.  And then, after they reset my account, it took another 5 phone calls to get the correct settings for my iPad and iPhone, with each tech person telling me something different.  They told me they could only provide me one solution and if that didn't work, I had to call back. Really????\r\nTech support hold times average 30 minutes to 50 minute just to reach a live person.  They all will confidently provide you their working solution, but often it is incorrect, causing frustration and the need to start all over again.  There are no supervisors to talk with and they have removed any process by which you can file a complaint.\r\nBottom line--they were once in the top 10 hosting companies consistently and now are consistently omitted from the top ten list.  I think that says it all.\r\n\r\n***Update 4/10/17 Email was once again totally wiped out. Took 47 minutes on hold, 19 minutes of issue \"resolution\" for them to tell me they didn't know what the issue was, but they could do a restore of the last backup from 3:23 am today.  So they did, and there were no emails since 4/2/17.  I tried to move service to another host company and BlueHost locked up emails.

I found In Motion Hosting through a client who was using them for their website hosting. About two years ago I purchased a VPS package with them and after a few months, I began moving a number of client websites over to the new VPS. I currently have about 35 client and personal hosting accounts within the VPS (Virtual Private Server).\r\n\r\nFor most website developers, having a responsive support team for troubleshooting websites is a necessity. Getting support is very straight forward. For non critical issues, I will open a support ticket and typically these tickets are responded to within an hour or two. They also offer online chat for more immediate issues and you can also talk to a support team member by phone.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS SUPPORT?\r\nSupport is not where the hosting provider tells me how to build a website or how to install specific software on the server or how to tweak website code.\r\n\r\nSupport is help configuring the server or assisting when a WordPress website suddenly has a white screen or won't connect to a database. Or it is help when a website is moved from another server and the website is not displaying correctly on the new server.\r\n\r\nSupport is also help bridging the gap between what I can do with my WHM (Web Host Manager) dashboard and more complex situations where I need help getting pointed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, In Motion Hosting sets a good example of how great customer service, a can-do attitude, and a consistent follow-through on technical issues all go together to create a great customer experience.\r\n\r\nHOSTING VALUE\r\nOften web developers gravitate to the lowest cost hosting companies, which is fine in theory. Who doesn't want a lot for very little?  But my experience has shown that you get what you pay for.\r\n\r\nTypically, low cost hosting services cut corners in order to provide extremely low cost hosting and often this means tech support suffers. I have learned this lesson the hard way.\r\n\r\nI have also learned that my time is valuable, and hosting companies like In Motion Hosting who are responsive and helpful make my job easier and actually save me time. The last thing I need is for a technical issue to drag on for several days and for a client to have a problem with their website that drags on and on.\r\n\r\nWith In Motion Hosting I have the confidence that they are there to help me when I need help and they keep everything running smoothly.\r\n\r\nI believe their pricing to be competitive and while they are not the least expensive, they are not the most expensive, and for me, they provide value.\r\n\r\nRecently I added a second VPS and I will soon have another 10 or so websites moved over from my old hosting company.\r\n\r\nLastly, I am not being paid to offer this review.", "picture_urls": null}, {"category": "", "rating": "5.0", "reviewed_at": "08/08/2011", "review_title": "\u201cSwitched to InMotion after a TERRRIBLE experience with...\u201d", "service_name": "services", "reviewer_name": "Kathy\u00a0H.", "absolute_url": "https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/inmotionhosting.com", "website_name": ["Sitejabber Online Business Reviews and Complaints"], "review_text": "Switched to InMotion after a TERRRIBLE experience with Netfirms, that caused site to be down for 5 days.

The last straw was when i just typed out a couple hours of information only to see it get deleted out of nowhere and was completely irreversible even though it said it had been saved. Never again should anyone be subjected to the incompetent nature of this terrible website builder, you deserve better people. If I could I would give Webs.com a negative 1 billion stars.

As it stands you would need to have a blog on another platform and then incorporate the link to that page into your website navigation.  But I digress.\r\n\r\nMy real issue with webs is that they have suffered numerous lengthy outages that have taken down user website and ability to access their dashboards, without ever notifying us.  I would learn my site was down by potential customers, or users of my e-blast who couldn't access content via links in my newsletters.  Calling them is only accessible to their premium subscribers so the rest of us are at the mercy of their chat platform.  I am not sure if Erin ad Mary are the only two employees or if those are the standard names used for their CSR's.  It doesn't really matter because they rarely have anything to say other than our engineers are working on it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, users are experiencing the inability to upload images and video to their sites.  I came across this issue two weeks ago when I tried to upload a photo for my newest blog.  So much for keeping content current\r\n, and by the way, this impedes my ability to to create new e-blasts.

They were very simple websites, but they were easy to build and it was free. I eventually paid for my own domain. But the 10 pages I used to be able to have on the free site suddenly said I couldn't go over 5, with no warning. So...I sucked it up and I paid for premium (so that I could use unlimited pages) which required me to sign up for a premium package. But I was adding the premium before my domain had expired and the started package includes a domain. So I went into their forums and specifically asked if the \"free domain\" I would get from the starter package could be used for my current domain. I was told, \"Oh yeah, sure,\" that the \"coupon\" i get would be automatically applied to my account. But it didn't. The time came that my domain was expiring (a domain name that is now attached to every book I've published). When I inquired why this wasn't happening, the guy who emailed me back said something along the lines of, \"Oh sorry, she was wrong, the coupons can only be used on NEW sites.\" So, I paid to keep my domain, because transferring the domain somewhere is a pain and I didn't have enough time to look into it. I still have that \"free domain\" coupon, because I can't use it. \r\n\r\nSometime last year is when I started noticing the big problems. Website pages would lag on loading, or the site would go down completely. It always came back up and I still had at least a year on my domain. But one day, the site builder stopped working. Long story short, I found they deleted the theme I only just a week prior switched, rendering it useless. Without even bothering to tell me. I found out when my website wouldn't publish. \r\n\r\nThen the site builder went down. I couldn't even access my dashboard, let alone pay for a subscription had I wanted to. Nothing worked. And apparently it happened to hundreds of sites and the only answers we were given was along the lines of \"we're working on it.\" \r\n\r\nEventually, the problem got fixed, but it went down again recently. I currently canNOT turn off my \"auto-renew\" on my domain (and I want to because they're not getting anymore of my money). Odd pictures just started showing up on my published website. As in, pictures that aren't even in my files. And the pictures that were supposed to be there were still in my files. It made no sense. I had to re-upload the very same pictures. Something I've had do a lot over the last couple of years. \r\n\r\nSo I went looking into their help forums. They used to leave threads telling us what problems they were noticing etc. Suddenly there are NONE of these threads. Just a very generic \"help\" menu. I sent them an email, telling them about the problems i was having, but heard nothing.  \r\n\r\nAlso, they send me a LOT of spam when they have sale on premium packages. I'm already a premium member, yet they still send me these. At least 1 every day. Oh, and when you sign up for the premium packages, they also don't tell you that their \"premium themes\" don't apply to the \"starter\" package (which I only subscribe for so I can get unlimited pages). You have to pay for the more expensive package if you want anything other than a no-frills theme. \r\n\r\nI have a few months left before my domain runs out next (I paid for 2 years; they never told me 1 year was possible. I only found out from other users on their FB page), but I'm going to take the time to transfer my domain somewhere else. Because the site just isn't as good as it used to be anymore and I'm sick of it.

I used webs because it was the cheapest option and the only site I felt comfortable using. At first, I loved the look of my site and I felt like a real professional. When I started looking at other photographers' websites for inspiration and guidance, I began to notice how unprofessional my site looked compared to theirs. I decided to reach out to webs.com and asked to transfer my domain in early 2016 and was told I couldn't. I just stuck with the site hoping I could make it look more professional but couldn't.

It is now 12:30PM on Janurary 28th and my domain still hasn't transferred. When I contacted the support team, I was told that they would let the senior techs know about my situation and they'd complete the transfer.
