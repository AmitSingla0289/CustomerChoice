When I first subscribed it was a matter of pricing->feature value, but the cPanel experience was weak and the upgrade process was hit and miss. Over the past three years BlueHost has resolved any issues I had with them.\nThey're cPanel is greatly improved, they're feature set is much broader with few limitations, and with their new reseller account options I can host clients without any of the problems I used to run in to. BlueHost's cPanel in particular is where the best value comes. When I started my subscription with them I was less than savvy about many things relating to hosting or marketing or anything else that would otherwise lead to solid web presence.\nThere are many included tools and promotions that BlueHost provides with the subscription that put me on the right track and led to more opportunities as I matured. Technical expertise is not a requirement as BlueHost has most of those tools available to you, but there is still enough flexibility for more savvy developers to get their hands dirty. The only one quorum I have is a lack of root level access, but that isn't a dealbreaker for myself personally.\nOverall I'd consider BlueHost as one of my favorite webhosts. There are others I've tried, but BlueHost has been the most reliable and their customer service team has always been quick and knowledgeable.

I always give their support team kudos. However, in the past year, their email is getting worse and worse.\nTheir servers are black listed and they don't do anything about it. They respond with \"Try sending it again in an an hour when the servers rotate.\" This affects everyone in my business. We are working and with this kind of terrible service, we never know if your email goes through to a client or customer.\nTheir excuse is that email servers are shared so things like this happen. When I point out that email has been this way since before AOL and companies like AOL, gmail and others seem to deliver email just fine, the rep always seems to finally admit the senior management at Bluehost is not funding email support to force people to buy paid email services. IMO, email is a cost-of-doing-business type of feature.\nMeaning if I buy a car, a steering wheel is a cost-of-doing-business feature. I have a car (Bluehost) and it used to have steering wheel one hundred percent of the time. Now, the steering wheel is only there 70 of the time while I am driving.\nI then call the service department, they tell me it's not a safety risk. I should keep the car but get an Uber (Paid Gmail) to be able to get to work every day for reliability and safety. My answer is no thanks.\nI just get any other car on the market, even one like GoDaddy which I hate, and get a working steering wheel.

They assigned me a temporary domain name which support told me would last from 25 minutes to 5 hours. During this time I was able to access Wordpress and start putting the page for my blog together.\nAfter 5 hours I contacted BlueHost live chat to ask how long it would take for my domain name to become active. The person on chat never seemed to understand my problem. I even copied and pasted the error message from their site that explained the situation but to no avail.\nI couldn't see how my blog looked or access email while the domain remained with a temporary address. On Sunday I tried 2 more times with live chat but couldn't get my problem resolved. I tried again on Monday and after chatting for a few minutes I realized that I wasn't going to have my problem resolved and asked for a refund.\nThe person took my information and said that I would be getting my refund. The refund hadn't been posted to my credit card account on Tuesday so I called customer support and talked to a person who understood my original problem and offered to solve it. I said no, I would just like to get my refund.\nThey told me that I wouldn't be getting the refund for my domain name purchase because the person who was processing the refund on Monday didn't complete the process and it had been more than 3 days since I had purchased the domain name and they would only refund that purchase during the first 3 days. (By the way, Tuesday was 3 days after Saturday) I received an email detailing my refund (less the price paid for the domain name) on Tuesday but it hadn't been posted to my credit card on Wednesday. I filed a claim with the credit card company and they have issued me a provisional credit. I know that stuff happens but when a problem is brought to the attention of a support person the problem should be worked on.\nThe live chat people should have been able to solve my problem or pushed it up to someone who could. If you use BlueHost I would recommend that you use their phone support instead of live chat for even the most simple problems.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": ["https://media.whoishostingthis.com/2/v241/images/host-logos/bluehost.png"]}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Jen Braaksma", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/", "website_name": "", "review_text": "\n            Well, overall I think the service is okay. I am an English teacher and I use Bluehost for my blog about writing. I use their WordPress hosting service and I am satisfied with the service, although there are some flaws.\nPros:\n-Easy setup\n-Very good uptime (all the time)\n-Good speed\nCons:\n-Support is not great\n-The price is higher than other hosting\nDuring my last semester of teaching I was approached by one of my students who said he could optimize my site and get many more readers quickly, but found some security flaws in the site which should be fixed first. He offered to fix it himself for free, but first I contacted support. They did not do much and claimed the site was in good standing with security.\nThey have their own \"intrusion detection/prevention system\" which stops their service from getting hacked, but I found out it doesn't actually protect my website. I reluctantly let the student fix my site after giving him my account details and he managed to find all kinds of flaws from the inside as well. He fixed most of them within a couple of days, from bad configuration, bad plugins, and hiding my personal email/account.\nI'm not very good with this kind of stuff but was astonished by how much the student was able to do that BlueHost was not able to do. The student also showed me that there were much cheaper hosting plans I could have gotten, and sure enough he was right, so I don't think the value is great for this host. Other than all that, the first setup of the website was really easy, only a few clicks and it was ready. Everything went smoothly and although the site isn't super fast, it is up 100% of the time (or very close, I don't know what happens when I'm not on it.)\nOverall I give this host somewhere between 3/4 stars.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": ["https://media.whoishostingthis.com/2/v241/images/host-logos/bluehost.png"]}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Mohan Polydath", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/", "website_name": "", "review_text": "\n            I wanted to setup my company website, after comparing and reading reviews of many webhost, I finally found BlueHost, believe me I had the best experience with bluehost, their cpanel have all the features and helped me a lot to setup my website in just a single day, I found the web hosting price in my budget, I would really recommend bluehost for any web hosting needs.\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": ["https://media.whoishostingthis.com/2/v241/images/host-logos/bluehost.png"]}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Saikat Ghosh", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/", "website_name": "", "review_text": "\n            Bluehost has a very nice list of features, and the best of them being the 'Unlimited Bandwidth\" in a very low cost, cheaper than many others as of the quality of service that Bluehost provides, but what I don't like about the host is that they have a good customer service but some of their employees keep turning rude at some moments!\n\n                        \u00a0\n                    ", "picture_urls": ["https://media.whoishostingthis.com/2/v241/images/host-logos/bluehost.png"]}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "4.5", "reviewed_at": null, "review_title": null, "service_name": "Bluehost", "reviewer_name": "Danish Ali", "absolute_url": "https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/", "website_name": "", "review_text": "\n            I'm using BlueHost Since last 2 to 3 Years, I found BlueHost to be reliable and customer friendly hosting service.
