I began using FatCow in 2010, when they were still in the US and using wind power. They were so good back then. I had the same domain with them since 2010.Fast forward to 2018. I had my domain set to auto-renew each year, and maybe I turned it off or there was a glitch this year, I'll never know what happened. My domain expired on Jan 26, 2018. I got the email from FatCow saying it expired, so I logged in on January 29th to renew it. All went well, I paid for it, they charged me. I paid for domain privacy then as well. I used my domain up until March 20th, when abruptly I saw I could no longer login and there was now a cached version of my site on there. I totally assumed my website had been hacked. I renewed it and paid for it in January and everything had been working fine for 2 months. I contacted FatCow and they told me the domain now was registered under GoDaddy. After much back and forth (well mostly forth, they never responded. I had to talk to Indians on the phone that couldn't tell me a thing), I was told they sold me domain THE SAME DAY it expired. No grace period, no redemption period. They really do not care about you or your business together and will try to take advantage of you as soon as an opportunity arrives.I have a new domain now, but am only getting about 1/3 the traffic to my ecommerce site I normally would get. The squatter that bought my domain says he'll sell it to me for $900. I will never give him the satisfaction. FatCow screwed me over, and they could care less. Your domain is not safe with them.

This is where my warning bells should have gone off.Warning #1 if you are planning on hosting anything more than a single page this is not the hosting platform for you. There support team is a darn joke and most of them don't speak anything more than 5 words of the English language. Warning #2 If you do have a wordpress site that has a few pages to it then good luck with it loading when more than 1 person is trying to go to your domain at the same time. It just wont happen.Warning #3 when you tell the support person that what you are experiencing is not on your end but is in fact on their end because of the error page you are getting they get defensive and then ask you if you have tried to do the task in a different browser. I had to call back 3 times and explain myself 3 different times for a lady to tell me this error message is because the file you are trying to download is too large you need to download the file in pieces. (I was trying to download my site backup)Warning #4 STAY AWAYWarning #5 don't cause yourself or your it guys the level of headache that will come with by having to deal with these guys. \u00a0Warning #6 their mail central portal has a document that says how to access your domain email by going to yourdomain.com/mailadmin but yet when you type in your domain email and the password it just goes into a spin cycle when you call support depending on who you get you might get an answer of oh it works for me, or of that is not a feature that is supported, or my personal favorite you must be typing in your password wrong.Warning #7 they do not have a audit trail of the hosting at all and heaving for bid if you give anyone access to the back end of your hosting site to do work on the database and they lock you out the support team has to email someone in the advanced support asking for you to be made whole again. They do not have the ability to transfer you to anyone in their department or anywhere else outside of their line. Warning #8 if you ask for a supervisor good luck they will tell you no one is available and then hang up on you.My advice as someone who has lots of experience dealing with this pain over the last 2 months is to run like the wind from this company. \n            \n    ", "picture_urls": ""}, {"category": "Hosting Service", "rating": "1.0", "reviewed_at": "24/07/2017", "review_title": null, "service_name": "NordVPN", "reviewer_name": "Jim W.", "absolute_url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fatcow-burlington", "website_name": ["Yelp"], "review_text": "\n            \n        \n                    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\n        \n            \n        7/24/2017\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n                    I have to chime in here. \u00a0All of these one star reviews are actually too generous. \u00a0This company have no support or management of any kind. \u00a0I currently am trying to edit a clients website and the files will not edit..

When i found out, I renewed the domain right away, went through the whole check out process and received the message saying the domain will be active in 24-48 hours. Since i needed to access my emails i contacted FatCow online support when their support rep told me that i actually need to pay extra $160 to make them to activate my domain again. When I was not happy about it, because there was nothing about it while renewing the domain, they started developing me and telling me there is nothing they can do and it is my fault and i should pay attention to such things, basically they don't care. I have a feeling that FatCow is one of those companies, that are just waiting for customer to make some kind of mistake so they can charge them for whatever fees they make up. Even though I supposed to monitor my domain renewals, I still think it is unfair that i was actually able to go through the renewal process and only found out that they want extra money after visiting their customer \"support\" department.

I am shocked by how inept they are. First, everything these people are saying about the service & performance is accurate. But I'm here to talk about the ransom and hostage situation they perform when you try to get your refund from them. I cancelled my hosting account. It took me forever, but they finally agreed to refund 1 yr of my unused hosting since I paid for a 2-yr plan and cancelled after 1 yr. Well I get an email from them confirming my refund has been processed. I wait 5 days, 10 days, it's nowhere. I just got off the phone with them, speaking to multiple people for almost an hour. Basically, they sent the refund (SUPPOSEDLY) to an old card that I had that must have been expired. They told me many times \"they did their part\" by issuing the refund. I have no proof of the refund, and no way to confirm they did. They gave me the last 4 digits of a card that I don't know what it is. Mind you, nobody ever asked me to CONFIRM my card info they were refunding it to. Instead, they claim they issue a refund, I don't get it, they claim they sent it to a card (which is not active so no idea they can actually claim that), and I don't have my money. This company is a complete sham. They don't even let you speak to a supervisor or billing specialist who is the one telling me they can;t do it. It's simple...reverse the supposed credit, I give you the correct CC#, and do it.

You would think that a dot com would have no problem doing such a thing. Aprox. 4 months of pleading my case they finally listened to those \"some calls may be recorded tapes\" and whalla, they realized that it was indeed their mistake. Now, 3 more months have gone by since then. They agreed to rectify their mistake but have proceeded to do nothing. They have dis-respected my time, made countless empty promises and have missed meetings. I can not believe that this place is allowed to do business. BE AWARE, Fatcow Scam.

Unauthorized billing and no explanation as to why they did it.

When I said I would file a complaint with Visa about the unauthorized charge, the rep actually laughed and said \"oh, sorry to hear you're going to complain to Visa\", and that was IT! Then I moved the domain to another provider but FatCow would not cooperate with terminating the account, even after the transfer was done. They continued to send harassing emails \"confirming\" additional orders for more services that I hadn't placed & trying to bill me. After 6-7 hours on the phone with 4 different CS reps (starting over from scratch each time since of course they can't communicate between themselves), I finally got a confirmation the account is cancelled, which I hope sticks this time.
