But the worse things happened to me int he last month. Keep reading, it will worth it, since I will save you future trouble.\nAfter 7 years being a loyal costumer, last month my account was shutdown due to a payment being late. No problem, I contacted JustHost and asked if my data could still be recovered, since I was contacting in the last day of the deadline for the shutdown. In a chat session, support said that yes, they could. I paid for a month to see it that would be true. Nothing happened. I contacted the chat support again and informed the situation. The attendant said that no, actually all my files have been lost. I got upset, naturally. But in the middle of the session, the chat went offline. No problem, I tried a third time and after insisting on the situation, a senior specialist told that the information was incorrect: my files could be restored and in fact they were restored quite quickly to my File Manager within my CPanel.\nHowever, my websites did not come on-line again. I did yet another fourth chat with the support team. I was told that I should only wait for the DNS addresses to be updated. Sure, I waited. After seeing that nothing happened, I tried another chat a day later. I was told the same thing again. Now, a month after that, and with yet another month paid, my sites are still offline. Guess what: today I did try another chat. I waited 20 minutes for an attendant to reply. Then, after 2 hours \u2013 yes, two hours \u2013 of chatting and waiting, I was told that my databases were missing! Yes, all my data gone. The attendant said he/she would search if there was a backup. Notice: \u201cIF\u201d there was backup \u2013 and I\u2019ve been paying for that! At such point, my chat session crashed. What did I? Tried another chat session. This time a new attendant replied quickly, but took another 1 full hour to get to the same point where I was in the previous chat. He/she went even further and said that there were no databases associated to my account since before July 27th.\nHow can that even be possible? It seems that I was either 1) lied to when someone from the sales department said in July that if I paid the subscription the data would be restored; 2) lied to when told that my files and data were restored and that I should only wait for DNSs to be updated or 3) the support team of JustHost did recover my files but forgot to recover my databases!

The question I set out to explore was if it was possible to buy decent hosting very inexpensively, and JustHost seemed like a good website host to try. They offer really cheap prices for shared hosting, and I'd heard pretty good things about them on hosting forums.\nI had to send in a few tickets. Most of these were in the beginning. They weren't from real problems, but they were things that could have been documented a bit better. It turns out that most of the time, these things were really simple to understand, so I many have been over thinking everything a bit.\nAnyway, the staff was really friendly when I did send in support tickets. They didn't mind helping me resolve issues or answering my questions. The support team is great, and I believe that I got more than my money's work out of the support team.\nSupport is mostly through email or a chat box. You really can't expect to get one-on-one support over the phone or in person for this price. However, I think most of my emails got responded to very quickly, and I often got good answers during times when I didn't even expect to. So, somebody's staying up at night and on the weekends to babysit the tech support desk. That gives me a good feeling because my websites run 24/7.\nBesides hosting for all kinds of websites, you also get email and other goodies with this host. For example, they make it very easy to set up WordPress sites and sites with other common types of software packages. On some cheap hosts, they just give you hosting with no email, so you end up spending more for extras. They do not seem to be playing these kinds of games.\nMost of the time, everything runs just fine or is easy for me to figure out on my own. So, after getting my sites set up and running, I really didn't contact them a lot.\nAgain, I have to say that the host company was very friendly and helpful when I did need them, so I can't see why things would be different now. However, to be fair, I have not needed to contact the tech support desk for quite a few months. Of course, that is a good thing!\nMy experience is with the cheaper plan, and I've been pretty happy. If you really get a lot of traffic, you may want to do some research on other options. My site only gets a few hundred visitors a week, and the performance has been fine.\nSince this is shared hosting, there is always a risk of things slowing down if your site or another one on your server gets really busy.

I am happy to say that I count JustHost among the reliable inexpensive hosts that I use. I actually spread my websites out along a bunch of different sites because I work for different clients, and I don't like to keep everything in one basket.\nIf you are like me, and you just need cheap hosts with the basics, you may be interested in knowing what I think about this solution. I don't have experience with their upgraded plans, so you will have to do more research on your own for that.\nAnyway, most of the features are pretty intuitive, and I haven't needed a lot of support from the help desk. However, when I was getting everything set up, I did have a few questions that I didn't think were that clearly answered in the help files. I communicated with them, and the tech guy went out of his way to set things up for me. In fact, he even offered to do things for me, and that offer was way beyond what I expected.\nLike any cheaper shared host, you know you are sharing your server with a bunch of different websites. You have to rely upon the company to keep performance high even if one of those sites, or yours, gets hit with a lot of extra traffic. I'm happy to say that they have been pretty good.\nThere have been a couple of times that things slowed down, but the tech guys seemed to stay on top of it. I sent in a tech question, but I noticed that things got faster before I even got an answer. When I did get a reply, very quickly afterwards, I was happy to report back that everything seemed fine. The tech guy said he had balanced the load and sent a warning out to a site that needed to upgrade off of the shared hosting plan.\nSo, if you have a very large site that already gets tons of traffic every day, this cheaper hosting plan might not be the right solution. If you are like me, and you prefer quality traffic over massive quantity, or if you spread your traffic out between multiple sites and hosts, this is a great solution for you.\nReally, the only thing they could do is have a better FAQ page and documentation. It seems like a few things about this host are unique, and they don't really go into details, so that can get frustrating. As I wrote above, I use a lot of web hosts, so I think I should be able to find what I need without a lot of help.\nHowever, the great support sort of makes up for it.

We have a very small site that does not use many resources, but we found the site slow, with the site being throttled on many occasions with simple queries taking 5-10 seconds when they should be almost instantaneous. Raising these issues with their support didn't help matters either.\nFor some reason our support tickets would take around 15 hours to get a response, give or take a few hours. What is worse is that the replies never really dealt with the issue and were more of a generic type answer to get us off their backs. Unfortunately, when each reply takes that length of time you end up banging your head against a brick wall. Eventually, after complaining about the slow support response times, the matter was put in the hands of a manager who apologized and said they were going to handle it personally. They never responded after that, and the issue remains outstanding.\nAfter several more days, I decided to take the matter into my own hands and arrange to move to a new hosting provider. I just thought I would try one last time via their livechat to get a resolution to all of this, but it took 30 minutes to connect. The person on the livechat was useless, and after a while they escalated it to someone else. UNfortunately that person also had very little technical knowledge so I advised they should either contact my developer, or issue a refund.
